                        <h4>RGU signs pledge to support estranged students</h4>
                        <p>
                        As part of its ongoing commitment to widening access to Higher Education, 
                        RGU has signed the Stand Alone Pledge, which will provide additional support
                         to estranged students
                         Estranged students are those who apply for university and enrol on a course 
                         without the support of a family network. They may face particular challenges
                        in accessing and continuing in higher education and can benefit from bespoke
                        support and advice tailored to their individual circumstances.
                        By signing the pledge, RGU is publicly committing to this support and to begin 
                        working towards creating the right environment for these students to succeed in their 
                        studies. <a href="Read more.html">Read More</a>

                                </p>
                                Set between the rivers Don and Dee in the North-East of Scotland,
                                Aberdeen is the best Scottish city to live and work, according to 
                                The Good Growth for Cities Index 2019 run by PwC.Set between the 
                                rivers Don and Dee in the North-East of Scotland,
                                Aberdeen is the best Scottish city to live and work, 
                                according to The Good Growth for Cities Index 2019 run by PwC.Aberdeen
                                 is a port city in northeast Scotland, where the Dee and Don rivers meet
                                  the North Sea. With an offshore petroleum industry, the city is home to an 
                                  international population. It's also known as the ‘Granite City’ for its many 
                                  enduring grey-stone buildings. The 19th-century Marischal College is typical –
                                   a monumental Victorian landmark that’s now headquarters of the City Council
                                   <p>
                                    But mainly because this isn’t just a city by the sea, it’s a city of the sea. 
                                    A city where ships dock right up against the city-centre streets. Where urban dolphins
                                     leap at the harbour mouth. Where locals paddle-board and surf off the city beach. 
                                     And golden sands stretch for miles – towards vast dunes to the north and high cliffs to the south. 
                                     It’s a city of rivers too, where the Dee and the Don meet the sea, bringing crystal 
                                     clear waters from the Cairngorm mountains.This is a city with not one but two Old Towns: 
                                     Old Aberdeen, with its cobbled streets, mature trees and 15th century fortified cathedral –
                                      where Aberdeen’s first University was founded in 1495. And then there’s Footdee –
                                       known locally as Fittie – a quirky fishing quarter at the water’s edge, with squares of
                                     tiny cottages, flower-filled gardens and brightly painted
                                   </p>
